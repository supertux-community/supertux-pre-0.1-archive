= BUILT-IN LEVEL EDITOR =


USING THE BUILT-IN LEVEL EDITOR:
--------------------------------

When opening the leveleditor, a menu will appear. This
menu can be used to select or add level subsets.
A level subset is a collection of levels. Subsets can be chose
during gameplay when starting a game.

After selecting the subset, have a look at the level editor.
The button bar in the right is the place where you can control
the actions related with editing. You can select levels and add
throught there.
To select tiles (foreground or background) and enemies, the button
bar is the right place. There you can also save, test and setup
the level. It is also possible between two selection cursors! Give
a try to both.
A right click in a button bar button will give you a description
and a shortcut for it.

To change a tile, just press the tile you want to change with a
mouse left click. The current tile will be used. Depending
on the selection behavior, you can or not select more
than one tiles.
To scroll, you just have to point over the two arrow buttons, or
use the right button click.

There is a small help that can be reached by pressing F1.

To go back to the menu, just press Esc.

Now, do lots of levels and HAVE FUN!!

Please, send your levels or any art you created to the SuperTux's
mailinglist or to the maintainer (look at AUTHORS.txt).
